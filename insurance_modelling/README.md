# Data:

* Characteristics: gender of the insured person, age, salary and number of family members.
* Objective: number of insurance benefits received by the insured person in the last five years.

# Taks:

* Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.
* Task 2: Predict the probability that a new client will receive an insurance benefit. Can a predictive model perform better than a dummy model?
* Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits that a new client may receive using a linear regression model.
* Task 4: Protect customers' personal data without affecting the model from the previous exercise. 
It is necessary to develop a data transformation algorithm that makes it more difficult to recover personal information if the 
data falls into the wrong hands. This is called data masking or obfuscation. But the data must be protected in such a way that 
the quality of the machine learning models is not affected. It is not necessary to choose the best model, it is enough to 
demonstrate that the algorithm works correctly.
